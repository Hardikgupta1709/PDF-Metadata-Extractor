Therefore, ensuring the quality of PPG signals is crucial for accurate measurements, as these signals are susceptible to various artifacts and noises. This article proposes a derivative-based PPG (dPPG) signal quality assessment (SQA) method to distinguish high-quality data from artifact-laden signals. The proposed method includes a first-order derivative, followed by a 3-point moving average filter to smooth the high-frequency components present in the dPPG signal. Further, the smoothed dPPG signal is fed into 2, 4, and 6-layer 1D-convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) to classify it as a clean or noisy dPPG signal. The proposed derivative-based PPG-SQA method is tested using various PPG signals collected from standard databases. The noisy PPG signals are collected from the wrist-cup (WC-PPG) database, whereas acceleration (SYN-ACCE-PPG) and random noise (SYN-RN-PPG) affected PPG signals are synthetically generated using noise-free PPG (NF-PPG) signals. We evaluate the proposed method using performance metrics like sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), accuracy (ACC), model size (in MB), and processing time (PT). We also implemented the proposed method on the Raspberry Pi 4 (R-Pi-4) to study its real-time feasibility. The 6-layer 1D-CNN with 32 kernels using the ReLU activation function is observed to outperform the other models and existing PPG-SQA methods. The proposed method, when compared to NF signals, achieves: 99.84% of SE, 97.94% of SP, and 99.70% of ACC for WC-PPG; 99.79% of SE, 100.00% of SP, and 99.96% of ACC for SYN-RN-PPG; and 84.48% of SE, 74.63% of SP, and 78.17% of ACC for SYN-ACCE-PPG, respectively. Results demonstrate that selecting the appropriate 1D-CNN model can achieve higher SE, SP, and ACC with a lower computational load on PC-CPU and R-Pi computing platforms. Furthermore, we test the reliability and robustness of the dPPG-1D-CNN-SQA model using the unseen databases. Our model may reduce the false alarms and energy consumption of wearable healthcare devices, which have limited battery capacity and computational resources.","PPG signal quality assessment, PPG signal analysis systems, blood pressure estimation, PPG-derived respiration rate, false alarm reduction, wearable health monitoring devices, convolutional neural network",Machine Learning,Full Paper,,Resource-Efficient_Derivative_PPG-Based_Signal_Quality_Assessment_Using_One-Dimensional_CNN_With_Optimal_Hyperparameters_for_Quality-Aware_PPG_Analysis.pdf
SUB20251016221614,2025-10-16 22:16:14,Spatial Feature Extraction of Vectorcardiography via Minimum Volume Ellipsoid Enclosure in Classifying Left Ventricular Hypertrophy,Yasuyuki Kataoka; Hitonobu Tomoike,hitonobu.tomoike@ntt-research.com,hitonobu.tomoike@ntt-research.com; yasuyuki.kataoka@ntt-research.com,Manipal University Jaipur,"The voltage criteria used to diagnose left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the chest and limb leads are by no means absolute. In addition to QRS voltages, QRS axis and duration, and P wave characteristics, repolarization (ST-T) changes have been focused attention due to their representing left ventricular overload. Vectorcardiography (VCG) has been studied specifically on its repolarization abnormality. The present study aims to devise spatial feature extraction of VCG and assess it in the LVH classification task. A minimum volume ellipsoid enclosure was applied to six segments obtained from upstroke and downstroke of each P, QRS, and T loops of a single-beat VCG. For the evaluation, VCG and 12 lead ECG dataset along with LVH labels of 61 subjects were derived from public open data, PTB-XL. These classification performances were compared with the LVH diagnosis criteria in the standard 12 lead ECG. As a result, the Random Forest classifier trained by the proposed spatial VCG feature resulted in accuracy of 0.904 (95% confidence interval: 0.861-0.947) when the classbalanced dataset was evaluated, which slightly exceeded the feature of 12 lead ECG. The feature importance analysis provided the quantitative ranking of the spatial feature of VCG, which were practically similar to those of ECG in the LVH classification task. Since the VCG are spatially comparable with three-dimensional data of CT, MRI, or Echocardiography, VCG will shed light on the spatial behavior of electrical depolarization and repolarization abnormalities in cardiac diseases.","os , signals",Computer Science,Short Paper,,Spatial_Feature_Extraction_of_Vectorcardiography_via_Minimum_Volume_Ellipsoid_Enclosure_in_Classifying_Left_Ventricular_Hypertrophy.pdf
